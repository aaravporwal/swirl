    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hallo! I'm Aarav, a 15 year old High School student and programmer from India.</p>
    <p>I love to build websites and mainly use HTML, CSS and JS :)</p>
    <p>I believe there's always something new to learn, and I'm constantly looking for ways to improve myself. Whether it's coding, trying out a new skill, or just discovering something random.</p>
